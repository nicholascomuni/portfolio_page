                        <p>I was responsible for developing the work in the experimental area.<br>
                            Metrics of the experiment were collected every day to evaluate the treatments, using statistical methods such as ANOVA and Tukey's test.
                            <br>
                            I developed an application to manage ongoing experiments.<br>
                            The application was developed using Django framework.<br>
                            Daily, data used to be collected from the experiments, and were placed into spreadsheets, which in turn were transferred to an S3 bucket.<br>
                            
                            Within each experiment or ongoing project, there were dashboards generated by Plotly. The dashboards were generated by Python tasks in background using Redis Queues. Data analysis was performed entirely with Python and libraries such as Pandas.</p>
